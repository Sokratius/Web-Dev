        <h1>THE LOVER'S LITANY</h1>
        <p>
            Eyes of gray—the sodden quay,<br>
            Driving rain and falling tears,<br>
            As the steamer heads to sea<br>
            In a parting storm of cheers.<br>
            Sing, for Faith and Hope are high.<br>
            None so true as you and I—<br>
            Sing the Lovers' Litany:—<br>
            "Love like ours can never die!"
        </p>
